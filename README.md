# Infestation-VFX
Using unity VFX, this is what I imagine the D&amp;D spell Infestation would look like when cast

## Rune Design
The rune and magic circle were created in the didigtal drawing software, Krita.
The process involced drawing the individual components of the magic circle in different layers, then exporting each layer on a transparent background to be unsed in the Unity Game Engine

## Unity Implementation

Particle systems where used to spawn in the magic circle's components as a base for the Infestation spell

This is the effect at it's most basic level
